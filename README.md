This is a collection of non-diversified keys.

## Checklist for Non-Diversified Keys

Here is a quick checklist to ensure the key is not diversified:

1. **Find the Key(s)**: Use your favorite attack to find the key or keys.
2. **Test the Key(s)**: Try reading the tag using the key or keys.
3. **Double-Check**: Test the key or keys again by reading a different tag from the same system.

If the key(s) are valid **on both tags**, they should be non-diversified, and you are welcome to share them.

## How to Load it on Flipper Zero

Simply place the `mf_classic_dict.nfc` file in the microSD card under the `nfc/assets` directory, overriding the existing file.

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Note**: This file will be overwritten after each firmware update,  
so you must replace it after each update or compile your firmware with this dictionary.
