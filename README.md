# NFC_keys

This is a collection of not-diversified keys.
Feel free to change name and extension to use it with your favourite device/software.


If you want help, you can send the keys you collect, but BE SURE THEY AREN'T DIVERSIFIED.

============================================================================================================================
  Here is a quick checklist to be sure the key is not-diversified:
 
  1) Find the key/keys with your favourite attack.
  2) Test the key/keys reading the tag.
  3) Test the key/keys again reading a different tag from the same system.
 
  If the key/keys is/are valid on both tags, it/they should be not-diversified and you are pretty wellcome to share them.
============================================================================================================================

You can open a pull request with the key/keys you discovered.
Every few weeks I'll merge them in the dictionary.

THANK YOU!
